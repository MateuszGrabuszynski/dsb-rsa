# RSA
Cipher and decipher with RSA algorithm. Program written in C# for Data security basics classes.
## Used libraries
* System (Collections, Linq, Text, Threading and Numerics).

## Ciphering
* p & q - prime numbers between 1 000 and 100 000,
* m - message to be ciphered.

## Deciphering
* d & n - RSA keys,
* ciphered - message to be deciphered.
